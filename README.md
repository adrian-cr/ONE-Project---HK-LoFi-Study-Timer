This is a personal project based on a coding challenge in Oracle Next Education's front-end development course, in which I'm currenly enroled. Since I'm a great fan of Hollow Knight and the beautiful music this videogame features, I decided to make a simple yet useful tool for time management and work optimization by combining the famous Pomodoro technique and soothing background lo-fi HK covers by Collosia.

The site was 100% built with vanilla JS/CSS/HTML as a challenge to both test my abilites in limited environments and consolidate my understanding of web foundationsâ€”and it cerainly proved to be one!

I hope this tiny project can help you achieve your goals through organizational thinking and comforting sounds.
